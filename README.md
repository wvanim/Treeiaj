**Treeia**, system topology:

It is an empty container, similar to the original idea of the PC:
a neutral box filled with electronic cards.

Treeia AI acts as a carrier for typed, XML-like structures.

To understand the limits of Treeia, imagine a diagram that represents a tree:
not to describe its content, but only to define its shape.# Treeiaj
Document format designed for AI prompts: a tree of typed components

Sample : The Time/Space prompt is composed of two layers:

- treeia: a vehicle (illustrated by the blue car), a generic container capable of
carrying different contents.

- tispi: the internal geometry (illustrated as the driver in the second image),
representing the Time/Space structure itself
(Piece/Face, Timeline, Tracks, Keys).
